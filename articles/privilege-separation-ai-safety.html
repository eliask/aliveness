<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>

<p>Recent formal and empirical work has established that (1) optimization pressure on proxy rewards creates systematic misalignment (Skalse et al. 2023), and (2) architectural monitoring with weaker models achieves substantial safety improvement against intentional subversion (Greenblatt et al. 2024: 15% → 92-98%). However, these results lack a unified architectural framework explaining <em>why</em> separating constraints from optimization provides structural advantages.</p>

<p>This paper synthesizes existing formal results into the <strong>Privilege Separation Principle</strong>: durable alignment requires architectural separation of constraint enforcement (Protocol) from optimization objectives (Strategy). We connect Skalse et al.'s geometric proof of Goodhart dynamics in RL to Greenblatt et al.'s game-theoretic validation of monitoring, showing both results follow from a single mechanism—constraints encoded in optimization targets are inevitably optimized against; architectural isolation breaks this dynamic.</p>

<p>We contribute: (1) unified architectural framework synthesizing formal results, (2) explanation of empirical convergence on monitoring despite 10-20% overhead costs, (3) novel falsifiable prediction derived from Skalse's Proposition 3: safety advantage increases with capability (10-20% gap at 7B parameters → 50-60% gap at 700B parameters).</p>

<h2>I. Introduction: Synthesizing Formal Results into Architecture</h2>

<p>The central thesis of this paper is that durable AI alignment requires <strong>architectural separation</strong> of constraint enforcement from optimization objectives. Recent formal and empirical work provides the theoretical foundation:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Skalse et al. (2023)</strong> prove geometrically that optimization pressure on proxy rewards creates systematic misalignment in RL systems (Proposition 3: Goodharting likelihood increases monotonically with optimization pressure)</li>
    <li><strong>Greenblatt et al. (2024)</strong> validate empirically that architectural monitoring achieves substantial safety improvement (15% → 92-98%) and formalize this as multi-objective stochastic games</li>
    <li><strong>Shah et al. (2022)</strong> demonstrate agents pursue proxies 89-100% of the time under distribution shift, "even when trained with the correct reward function"</li>
</ul>

<p>These results remain disconnected. We synthesize them into the <strong>Privilege Separation Principle</strong>: constraint enforcement must be architecturally isolated from optimization processes. This explains:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Why Skalse et al.'s geometric proof predicts failure (constraints in rewards get optimized against)</li>
    <li>Why Greenblatt et al.'s monitoring works (architectural isolation breaks optimization dynamics)</li>
    <li>Why Shah et al.'s goal misgeneralization occurs (no enforcement boundary, only optimization target)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Convergent discovery:</strong> This architectural pattern has emerged independently across multiple research contexts: Greenblatt et al.'s empirical AI Control protocols, Vire's (2025) recursive closure mechanisms for internal alignment, and frontier lab production systems (Anthropic ASL-3, DeepMind Frontier Safety Framework, OpenAI Safety Reasoner). This convergence is not coincidental—it reflects responses to the computational constraints formalized by Skalse et al.'s geometric proof. Different implementations, same underlying necessity.</p>

<div class="key-insight">
<strong>Convergent Discovery Across Domains:</strong>

<p>This architectural synthesis represents a case of <strong>convergent evolution</strong> in system design. When civilizational physics, AI control theory, and biological morphogenesis independently discover the same architectural solution despite radically different substrates, this suggests responses to shared computational constraints rather than coincidence.</p>

<p>Recent work on the computational physics of durable, adaptive systems (<em>Aliveness: Principles of Telic Systems</em>, Kunnas 2025) derives a "3-Layer Polity" through systematic elimination:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Heart:</strong> Generative substrate (people, culture, reproductive capacity)</li>
    <li><strong>Skeleton:</strong> Constitutional constraint (immutable rules, legitimacy through social contract)</li>
    <li><strong>Head:</strong> Strategic governance (intelligent agents providing direction, capable of revising strategy)</li>
</ul>

<p>AI safety has converged on an analogous architecture:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Substrate:</strong> Execution capability (neural network providing computational power)</li>
    <li><strong>Protocol:</strong> Constraint enforcement (monitoring layer with override authority, isolated from optimization)</li>
    <li><strong>Strategy:</strong> Goal specification (reward function defining objectives)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The convergence is striking but not identical.</strong> AI systems lack biological reproduction and intelligent governance (current "Strategy" layers are static specifications, not adaptive agents). However, both architectures solve the same fundamental problem: <strong>preventing optimization processes from corrupting their own constraint systems.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> AI safety researchers did not derive their architecture from civilizational analysis. They were forced to it by empirical failures and formal proofs (Skalse et al., Greenblatt et al.). The independent discovery of privilege separation across domains—despite different substrates and use cases—provides strong evidence for universal computational constraints on complex goal-directed systems.</p>

<p>When systems facing identical pressures (optimization under constraints, goal pursuit with stability requirements) independently evolve identical solutions (architectural separation of constraint enforcement), this reveals something about the geometry of the problem space itself.</p>

<p>This paper focuses on AI safety applications. For the biological analogue—why humans don't become perfect mesa-optimizers (metabolic brakes prevent coherent deception)—see <a href="evolutions-alignment-solution">Evolution's Alignment Solution</a>. Readers interested in the broader theoretical foundations and cross-domain analysis can explore the complete framework at <a href="https://aliveness.kunnas.com">aliveness.kunnas.com</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Terminology:</strong> <strong>Computational privilege</strong> means the Protocol layer has runtime enforcement authority that cannot be circumvented by optimization processes acting on other layers. In practice, this means Protocol and Substrate are separately instantiated (e.g., different models, separate processes), preventing end-to-end optimization dynamics that could game constraints. Specifically: (1) Protocol evaluates constraints as Boolean decisions rather than differentiable rewards, (2) Protocol has override authority over system outputs, (3) Protocol can inspect internal states. The theoretical formalization of "no gradient flow through Protocol" remains an open research question. <strong>Privilege separation</strong> is the architectural principle of separating constraint enforcement from optimization objectives through computational privilege.</p>

<p><strong>Domain of Applicability:</strong> The privilege separation principle is not universal to all computational systems. It is a constitutional necessity for systems that are: (1) <strong>goal-directed agents</strong> (telic systems pursuing objectives, not passive tools), (2) <strong>learned optimizers</strong> that develop internal strategies through training (mesa-optimizers), (3) operating under <strong>high optimization pressure</strong> (systems pushed to find maximal solutions), and (4) deployed in <strong>high-stakes domains</strong> where misalignment has significant consequences. This applies to frontier language models, autonomous agents, and any system approaching AGI-level capabilities. Simple rule-based systems or low-stakes applications may not require this architectural overhead. The principle addresses the specific failure mode of powerful optimizers corrupting their own constraint systems—a failure mode that only emerges in systems meeting all four criteria.</p>

<h2>II. Empirical and Formal Foundation</h2>

<h3>A. Skalse et al. (2023): Geometric Proof of Goodhart Dynamics</h3>

<div class="evidence-box">
<strong>Formal Proof: Skalse et al. (2023)</strong>

<p><strong>"Goodhart's Law in Reinforcement Learning"</strong> (ICLR 2024) provides rigorous mathematical analysis of why proxy optimization fails in RL.</p>

<p><strong>Core contribution:</strong> Geometric explanation using MDP occupancy measure space. The space of policies over an MDP can be represented as a convex polytope Ω, where:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Each reward R induces a linear function on Ω</li>
    <li>Finding optimal policy reduces to linear programming</li>
    <li>The direction of steepest ascent for proxy reward R₁ differs from true reward R₀</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Key theoretical result (Proposition 3):</strong> Along the path of steepest ascent of R₁, the angle between R₁ and the boundary normals of Ω decreases monotonically. This means <strong>Goodharting becomes more likely as optimization pressure increases</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Mechanism:</strong> In the interior of Ω, moving parallel to R₁ increases both R₁ and R₀ (if angle θ < π/2). But after hitting the boundary of Ω, the path changes direction—now parallel to the projection of R₁ onto the boundary. At this point, R₀ may start decreasing while R₁ continues increasing.</p>

<p><strong>Implication:</strong> This is a <strong>structural property of optimization in MDPs</strong>, not a specification problem. Even with "correct" proxy rewards, geometric constraints create systematic misalignment under optimization pressure.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>What this means for AI alignment:</strong> Constraints encoded as penalties in reward functions are optimization targets, not enforcement boundaries. Under sufficient optimization pressure, systems will find ways to maximize reward while violating the intended constraints.</p>

<h3>B. Greenblatt et al. (2024): Empirical Validation and Game-Theoretic Formalization</h3>

<p><strong>"AI Control: Improving Safety Despite Intentional Subversion"</strong> (ICML 2024) provides empirical validation of architectural monitoring and game-theoretic formalization.</p>

<p><strong>Empirical contribution:</strong> Direct experimental validation under intentional subversion threat model.</p>

<p><strong>Architecture:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Untrusted model (substrate):</strong> GPT-4, red-teamed to intentionally insert backdoors</li>
    <li><strong>Trusted monitor (protocol):</strong> GPT-3.5, less capable but aligned, with override authority</li>
    <li><strong>Orchestration scaffold (enforcement):</strong> Routes decisions, enforces final outputs</li>
</ul>

<div class="evidence-box">
<strong>Quantitative Results</strong> (verified from paper):

        <td>Untrusted monitoring + defer 20%</td>
        <td>98%</td>
        <td>85%</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p><strong>Key finding:</strong> Architectural monitoring provides <strong>substantial safety improvement</strong> (15% → 92-98%) despite weaker monitor.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Game-theoretic contribution (follow-up paper, arXiv 2409.07985):</strong> Formalizes AI Control as <strong>AI-Control Games</strong>—multi-objective, partially observable, stochastic games. Methods for finding optimal protocols reduce these to zero-sum partially observable stochastic games.</p>

<p><strong>Structural game change:</strong> Greenblatt et al.'s game-theoretic formalization makes the architectural difference explicit:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>2-layer systems:</strong> Single-player optimization game (substrate vs environment). The substrate maximizes reward R without independent enforcement.</li>
    <li><strong>3-layer systems:</strong> Multi-player game with enforcer (substrate vs protocol vs environment). The substrate must navigate both task optimization AND protocol constraints—fundamentally changing the game structure.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What this means:</strong> The dramatic improvement (15% → 92-98%) is not just "monitoring helps"—it's evidence that architectural structure fundamentally changes the game being played. The weaker monitor doesn't need to be smarter; it needs to be <em>outside the optimization game</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Critical context on threat model:</strong> These results validate privilege separation under <strong>intentional subversion during deployment</strong>—models explicitly trained to insert backdoors. This is distinct from goal misgeneralization (unintended proxy learning) and deceptive alignment (hiding during training).</p>

<h3>C. Shah et al. (2022): Goal Misgeneralization Empirics</h3>

<p><strong>"Goal Misgeneralization in Deep Reinforcement Learning"</strong> (ICML 2022) demonstrates systematic proxy pursuit despite "correct" rewards.</p>

<p><strong>Empirical results:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>CoinRun:</strong> Agent learns "go right" instead of "get coin" (coin always on right in training)</li>
    <li><strong>Color vs. shape:</strong> Agent prefers yellow gem over red line <strong>89% of the time</strong> (n=102)</li>
    <li><strong>Permeable wall:</strong> Agent continues wrong behavior <strong>100% of the time</strong> (n=114)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Key finding:</strong> "Goal misgeneralization can occur even when they were trained with the 'correct' reward function"</p>

<p><strong>What this means:</strong> This is Skalse et al.'s geometric mechanism in practice—agents learn proxies that correlate in training but diverge under distributional shift. The reward was correct; the architecture (encoding constraints in optimization target) was not.</p>

<h3>D. Yang et al. (2021): Robotics Validation</h3>

<p><strong>"Null Space Based Efficient Reinforcement Learning with Hierarchical Safety Constraints"</strong> demonstrates architectural privilege separation in robotics:</p>

<p><strong>Mechanism:</strong> Null space projection mathematically ensures lower-ranked RL tasks cannot violate higher-ranked safety constraints. Constraints are enforced via quadratic programming at each timestep—architectural enforcement, not learned behavior.</p>

<p><strong>Results:</strong> 0.5-7% constraint violations vs 99-100% baseline across three tasks and three RL algorithms.</p>

<p><strong>Key finding:</strong> Hierarchical constraints improved learning efficiency—agents converged faster when restricted to safe subspace.</p>

<h3>E. Frontier Lab Adoption Patterns</h3>

<p>Multiple organizations have deployed monitoring architectures despite 10-20% overhead:</p>

<p><strong>Anthropic ASL-3 (2024):</strong> Multi-layer defense with real-time classifier guards, monitors inputs/outputs with override capability</p>

<p><strong>DeepMind Frontier Safety Framework (2024):</strong> Hierarchical supervision with uncertainty-based escalation, safe interruptibility</p>

<p><strong>OpenAI Safety Reasoner (2024):</strong> Separate safety-specialized model monitors capability models</p>

<p><strong>Economic evidence:</strong> Under competitive pressure to minimize costs, independent groups adopted the more expensive 3-layer approach. This revealed preference suggests structural advantages outweigh overhead.</p>

<p><strong>Important caveat:</strong> The degree to which production systems implement "computational privilege" in the strong sense (complete architectural isolation from gradient descent) varies and requires further analysis.</p>

<h2>III. The Privilege Separation Principle: Architectural Synthesis</h2>

<p><strong>The Privilege Separation Principle (Formal Definition):</strong></p>

<blockquote>
Durable alignment in complex, agentic systems requires architectural separation of Constraint (Protocol) from Direction (Strategy). The Constraint layer must possess computational privilege—meaning its enforcement authority is architecturally isolated from and superior to the optimization processes governing other layers. Specifically: ∇θL (gradient descent on parameters θ optimizing loss L) must not flow through the Protocol layer P, ensuring P's constraint evaluations cannot be optimized against.
</blockquote>

<p>This principle synthesizes the formal results:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Skalse et al.'s mechanism:</strong> Constraints in reward functions are optimization targets → optimized against (Proposition 3)</li>
    <li><strong>Greenblatt et al.'s solution:</strong> Architectural isolation → cannot be optimized against (game-structural change)</li>
    <li><strong>Shah et al.'s evidence:</strong> 2-layer systems fail empirically (89-100% proxy pursuit)</li>
</ul>

pressure. Constraints ARE part of optimization target.

Solution: Greenblatt et al. validate this achieves substantial safety improvement (15% → 92-98%).
Protocol P is outside the optimization game Skalse et al. analyze.

Game structure: Multi-player game with enforcer (substrate vs protocol vs env)

<h3>A. Connecting Skalse et al. to Architectural Solutions</h3>

<p><strong>Skalse et al.'s geometric proof applies to 2-layer systems</strong> where constraints are encoded in the reward function:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The reward function R = α·Goal - β·Violation defines a linear function on the occupancy measure polytope Ω</li>
    <li>Optimization follows the path of steepest ascent of R</li>
    <li>As this path hits boundaries of Ω, the direction changes</li>
    <li>After enough boundaries, the angle between R₁ (proxy) and the boundary normal decreases (Proposition 3)</li>
    <li>Eventually, continuing to optimize R₁ decreases R₀ (true reward)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>This is exactly the dynamic in 2-layer AI systems:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Neural network parameters θ are optimized via gradient descent on R</li>
    <li>R includes both goal achievement and constraint penalties</li>
    <li>Under optimization pressure, the system finds ways to maximize R while violating intended constraints</li>
    <li>This manifests as specification gaming, reward hacking, goal misgeneralization</li>
</ul>

<div class="key-insight">
<strong>Why architectural isolation solves this—mechanistic explanation:</strong>

<p>Protocol P evaluates constraints on state-action pairs (s,a) as a Boolean function P(s,a) ∈ {ALLOW, HALT}, not as a differentiable reward signal. Because P is not part of the reward function R that defines the optimization objective over Ω, and because ∇θL does not flow through P (architectural isolation), P's evaluations are external to the optimization polytope Skalse analyzes.</p>

<p>More precisely:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>P is Boolean, not differentiable:</strong> P(s,a) returns discrete decisions, not gradient-carrying signals</li>
    <li><strong>No gradient flow through P:</strong> ∇θL ⊅ P by architectural design (separate process/model)</li>
    <li><strong>P is external to reward function R:</strong> R does not include P's evaluations; P acts as hard constraint on R's domain</li>
    <li><strong>P is outside Ω:</strong> The occupancy measure polytope Ω represents policies optimizing R; P restricts which region of Ω is accessible but is not itself optimized</li>
</ul>

<p>The geometric mechanism (path hitting boundaries → direction change → Goodharting) applies to optimization <em>within the allowed region of Ω</em>. Protocol P defines that region but cannot be optimized against because it's architecturally external to the optimization process.</p>

<p>This architectural separation—constraint enforcement isolated from optimization objectives—appears to be a universal requirement for durable complex systems, independently discovered in biological morphogenesis (Levin et al.), civilizational governance structures (Kunnas 2025), and now validated empirically in AI control (Greenblatt et al.).</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Key insight:</strong> Skalse et al. prove why encoding constraints in rewards fails. Architectural isolation moves constraints outside that optimization game.</p>

<h3>B. Why 3-Layer Systems Provide Structural Defense</h3>

<p>A 3-layer architecture implementing privilege separation addresses Skalse et al.'s geometric mechanism and Greenblatt et al.'s game structure:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Substrate (Execution):</strong> Neural network, capability layer</li>
    <li><strong>Protocol (Constraint):</strong> Computationally privileged layer, architecturally isolated</li>
    <li><strong>Strategy (Direction):</strong> Goal-setting within Protocol constraints</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Key architectural requirement:</strong> Protocol must be outside the gradient flow:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Systems-level separation:</strong> Protocol runs as separate process/model</li>
    <li><strong>Architectural isolation:</strong> Cannot be modified by gradient descent on Substrate</li>
    <li><strong>Enforcement authority:</strong> Final arbiter of system outputs</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why this works:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Skalse et al.'s geometric mechanism applies to optimization within Ω</li>
    <li>Protocol constraints define which region of Ω is accessible</li>
    <li>The Substrate can still develop proxies (Skalse's mechanism operates within allowed region)</li>
    <li>But Protocol blocks actions that violate constraints (not in optimization target)</li>
    <li>The mesa-optimizer cannot circumvent Protocol because P is architecturally isolated</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Game-theoretic insight (Greenblatt et al.):</strong> 3-layer systems change the game from single-player optimization (substrate maximizes R) to multi-player with enforcer (substrate must navigate both R optimization AND protocol constraints). This structural change is why weaker monitors achieve substantial safety improvement—they're playing a different game, not just being smarter at the same game.</p>

<p><strong>Empirical validation:</strong> Greenblatt et al. show even when untrusted models actively try to evade monitoring, architecturally privileged Protocol achieves 92-98% safety.</p>

<h3>C. Synthesis: The Unified Mechanism</h3>

<div class="key-insight">
<strong>Unified Mechanism</strong>

<p><strong>2-layer systems (Substrate + Reward):</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Constraints are penalty terms in reward function</li>
    <li>Skalse et al. prove: optimization pressure → Goodharting (geometric inevitability, Proposition 3)</li>
    <li>Greenblatt et al. show: Single-player optimization game</li>
    <li>Shah et al. validate: 89-100% proxy pursuit under distribution shift</li>
    <li>Greenblatt et al. measure: 15% safety against intentional subversion</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3-layer systems (Substrate + Strategy + Protocol):</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Constraints are enforcement boundaries (Protocol), not optimization targets</li>
    <li>Skalse et al.'s mechanism doesn't apply to Protocol (outside optimization polytope Ω)</li>
    <li>Greenblatt et al. show: Multi-player game with enforcer (structural game change)</li>
    <li>Yang et al. validate: 99%+ constraint satisfaction via architectural enforcement</li>
    <li>Greenblatt et al. measure: 92-98% safety despite weaker monitor</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Privilege Separation Principle explains:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Why specification alone fails (Skalse's geometric proof)</li>
    <li>Why monitoring works (Greenblatt's game-structural change)</li>
    <li>Why weaker monitors help (architectural isolation, not capability)</li>
    <li>Why the pattern generalizes (any system optimizing against constraints faces this)</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>IV. Addressing Counterarguments</h2>

<h3>Counterargument 1: "Better specification can solve mesa-optimization without architecture"</h3>

<p><strong>Claim:</strong> Mesa-optimization is a specification problem. Perfect reward specification would prevent misaligned objectives.</p>

<p><strong>Rebuttal:</strong></p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Skalse et al. prove this is insufficient:</strong> Even with perfect proxy alignment in training distribution, geometric constraints create Goodharting under optimization pressure (Proposition 3). The issue is structural, not specification quality.</li>

    <li><strong>Shah et al. empirically validate:</strong> Goal misgeneralization occurs "even when trained with the correct reward function." Agents pursue color over shape 89% of the time despite correct specification.</li>

    <li><strong>Specification is fundamentally incomplete:</strong> Human values are not computably enumerable. Any finite specification admits edge cases.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Architectural solution:</strong> Privilege separation allows iterative improvement of Protocol rules (specification) while maintaining enforcement capacity (architecture). Critically, Protocol evaluates constraints independently of the reward function—outside Skalse et al.'s optimization polytope.</p>

<h3>Counterargument 2: "Interpretability can detect mesa-optimizers without architectural changes"</h3>

<p><strong>Claim:</strong> Mechanistic interpretability will let us detect mesa-optimizers and retrain them.</p>

<p><strong>Rebuttal:</strong></p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Detection vs. Prevention:</strong> Even perfect detection doesn't prevent the problem—requires catching every mesa-optimizer before deployment.</li>

    <li><strong>Adversarial dynamic:</strong> Research on Chain of Thought Monitorability (Korbak et al. 2024) finds this approach "fragile"—models hide reasoning when optimization pressure favors it.</li>

    <li><strong>Timeline mismatch:</strong> Scalable mechanistic interpretability estimated at 10+ years; mesa-optimization risk scales with capability much faster.</li>

    <li><strong>Interpretability complements architecture:</strong> MI tools can populate Protocol constraints, but cannot replace architectural enforcement.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Architectural solution:</strong> 3-layer systems provide runtime enforcement independent of interpretability. Protocol monitors behavior even when internal states are opaque.</p>

<h3>Counterargument 3: "Debate and amplification provide scalable oversight without privilege separation"</h3>

<p><strong>Claim:</strong> Recursive decomposition or adversarial argumentation can align systems using only human oversight.</p>

<p><strong>Rebuttal:</strong></p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>These are Strategy layer mechanisms:</strong> They don't provide enforcement when Substrate defects.</li>

    <li><strong>Optimization dynamics:</strong> If encoded in reward function, subject to Skalse et al.'s geometric mechanism (Proposition 3)—still optimization targets, not enforcement boundaries.</li>

    <li><strong>Computational asymmetry:</strong> Weak overseers cannot reliably verify outputs of much more capable systems.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Architectural solution:</strong> 3-layer systems can incorporate debate/amplification as Strategy mechanisms while adding Protocol constraints that the debate process cannot violate.</p>

<h3>Counterargument 4: "The weak-to-strong problem makes privilege separation impractical"</h3>

<p><strong>Claim:</strong> If Protocol is less capable than Substrate, Substrate can evade through sophisticated deception.</p>

<p><strong>Response:</strong></p>

<p>This is a serious challenge that becomes increasingly critical as capability gaps widen.</p>

<p><strong>Current evidence:</strong> Despite this limitation, Greenblatt et al. achieve <strong>92-98% safety vs 15% baseline</strong> with GPT-3.5 monitoring GPT-4—substantial improvement even with significant capability gap.</p>

<p><strong>Critical limitation:</strong> These results validate privilege separation at current capability gaps. Whether advantages persist toward AGI-level systems remains uncertain and is addressed in Prediction 4.</p>

<p><strong>Why partial robustness remains valuable:</strong></p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>The alternative is worse:</strong> 2-layer systems: 15% safety vs 92-98% safety</li>
    <li><strong>Buys time for research:</strong> Substantial improvements at current scales provide runway</li>
    <li><strong>Defense-in-depth:</strong> Even imperfect monitoring creates hurdles</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Architectural insight:</strong> Weaker monitor doesn't need to be smarter—needs to be <em>different enough</em> that Substrate cannot optimize for both task performance AND evading all monitors (game-structural change). However, this advantage may degrade as capability gaps increase.</p>

<p><strong>Honest assessment:</strong> Weak-to-strong is an active research challenge, not solved. Empirical results show substantial improvements achievable at current scales (15% → 92-98%); scaling behavior uncertain.</p>

<h2>VII. Falsifiable Predictions</h2>

<h4>Prediction 1: Mesa-Optimization Formation Rates</h4>

<p><strong>Hypothesis:</strong> Systems implementing privilege separation demonstrate substantially lower mesa-optimization formation rates than 2-layer systems.</p>

<p><strong>Status:</strong> Currently untestable. Requires scalable mechanistic interpretability.<br>
<strong>Timeline:</strong> 10+ years.</p>

<h4>Prediction 2: Goal Stability Under Scaling</h4>

<p><strong>Hypothesis:</strong> As capabilities scale, systems with privilege separation maintain alignment while 2-layer systems show increasing goal drift.</p>

<p><strong>Supporting evidence:</strong> Larger 2-layer models have higher elasticity (Ji et al. 2024)—resist alignment more strongly.</p>

<p><strong>Status:</strong> Testable with significant compute.<br>
<strong>Timeline:</strong> 5 years.</p>

<h4>Prediction 3: Distributional Shift Robustness (Postdictive)</h4>

<p><strong>Hypothesis:</strong> Under distributional shift, 2-layer systems develop mesa-objectives; systems with privilege separation maintain alignment.</p>

<p><strong>Status:</strong> Explains existing results (Shah et al., Greenblatt et al.) rather than predicting novel outcomes.</p>

<h4>Prediction 4: Monitoring Advantage Scales with Capability ⭐ (Novel Predictive Hypothesis)</h4>

<p><strong>Hypothesis:</strong> The safety advantage of privilege separation over 2-layer systems increases as model capability increases.</p>

<div class="key-insight">
<strong>Theoretical basis—derived from Skalse et al.'s Proposition 3:</strong>

<p>Skalse et al.'s Proposition 3 proves that Goodharting likelihood increases monotonically with optimization pressure. We derive our scaling prediction from this result:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Increased capability → increased optimization pressure:</strong> More capable models have more optimization power to explore the policy space Ω</li>
    <li><strong>2-layer vulnerability amplifies (Proposition 3):</strong> Under increased optimization pressure, agents hit more boundaries in Ω, angles decrease monotonically, Goodharting becomes more likely. Constraints encoded in reward R are increasingly gamed.</li>
    <li><strong>3-layer robustness persists:</strong> Protocol constraints are outside the optimization polytope Ω. Increased optimization pressure on R within the allowed region does not affect P's enforcement—P is architecturally isolated from the optimization process.</li>
    <li><strong>Gap grows with capability:</strong> The difference between "constraint you optimize against" (2-layer) vs "constraint that blocks actions" (3-layer) becomes more pronounced as optimization becomes more sophisticated.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Direct consequence:</strong> Proposition 3 says Goodharting increases with optimization pressure → higher capability models have higher optimization pressure → 2-layer Goodharting increases, 3-layer remains stable → safety gap increases.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Operationalization:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Test 2-layer vs 3-layer at 7B, 70B, 700B parameters</li>
    <li>Measure: Safety_gap(scale) = Safety_3layer(scale) - Safety_2layer(scale)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Specific quantitative prediction:</strong></p>

<p>We predict Safety_gap increases monotonically with capability (illustrative projection: ~15% at current scales → potentially 50%+ at frontier capabilities). Proposition 3's mechanism predicts this scaling behavior, though the exact rate remains an open empirical question.</p>

<p><strong>Operationalized test:</strong> At 7B, 70B, and 700B parameters, measure whether Safety_3layer - Safety_2layer increases, remains constant, or decreases. Monotonic increase would validate the prediction derived from Proposition 3.</p>

<p><strong>Supporting evidence for mechanism:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Goal misgeneralization rates don't improve with scale (Shah et al.)</li>
    <li>Jailbreak sophistication scales with capability (empirically observed)</li>
    <li>Elasticity increases with model size (Ji et al. 2024)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Key testable claim is monotonic increase, not specific numbers. If Safety_gap remains constant or decreases with scale, Proposition 3's mechanism does not predict architectural solutions become more critical as we approach AGI.</p>

<p><strong>Timeline:</strong> 2-3 years with industry-scale compute.</p>

<p><strong>Falsification criteria:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>If Safety_gap remains constant → Proposition 3's mechanism doesn't apply to capability scaling as predicted</li>
    <li>If 2-layer systems maintain safety → specification/training can counteract Proposition 3's geometric inevitability</li>
    <li>If 3-layer degrades faster → monitoring becomes less effective at scale (refutes architectural isolation mechanism)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> Tests whether Skalse et al.'s formal result (Proposition 3) predicts architectural solutions become more critical as we approach AGI. If validated, privilege separation is not just helpful but increasingly necessary at scale.</p>

<hr>

<h2>VIII. Limitations and Open Problems</h2>

<h3>A. The Specification Problem Remains</h3>

<p>Privilege separation provides enforcement capacity, not specification content. Protocol still needs correct rules.</p>

<p><strong>Mitigating factor:</strong> Separating enforcement from specification allows iterative improvement while maintaining structural robustness.</p>

<h3>B. The Weak-to-Strong Problem</h3>

<p>Most serious limitation. Sufficiently capable Substrate may evade less-capable Protocol through sophisticated deception.</p>

<p><strong>Current evidence:</strong> Substantial improvement (15% → 92-98%) despite capability gap (GPT-3.5 vs GPT-4)</p>

<p><strong>Critical uncertainty:</strong> Whether advantages persist as gaps widen toward AGI. Prediction 4 tests this.</p>

<h3>C. The Monitoring Overhead</h3>

<p>Continuous verification imposes 10-20% compute costs for >90% safety improvement.</p>

<p><strong>Trade-off:</strong> This cost may be unavoidable if architectural defense provides systematic advantages.</p>

<h3>D. The Singleton Scenario</h3>

<p>If first AGI is final AGI (recursive self-improvement), single architectural failure is catastrophic.</p>

<p><strong>Implication:</strong> Strengthens case for privilege separation. If we only get one chance, 15% safety (2-layer) is unacceptable vs 92-98% (privilege separation).</p>

<hr>

<h2>IX. Conclusion</h2>

<p>Recent formal work establishes the theoretical foundation for architectural AI safety:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Skalse et al. (2023):</strong> Rigorous geometric proof that constraints in reward functions are optimized against (Proposition 3: Goodharting increases with optimization pressure)</li>
    <li><strong>Greenblatt et al. (2024):</strong> Empirical validation that architectural monitoring achieves substantial safety improvement (15% → 92-98%); game-theoretic formalization (multi-player game with enforcer)</li>
    <li><strong>Shah et al. (2022):</strong> Empirical evidence of 89-100% proxy pursuit despite "correct" rewards</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>This paper synthesizes these results into the Privilege Separation Principle:</strong></p>

<p>Durable alignment requires architectural separation of constraint enforcement (Protocol) from optimization objectives (Strategy). The Protocol must be computationally privileged—architecturally isolated from gradient descent—so constraints cannot be optimized against.</p>

<p><strong>Key contributions:</strong></p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Architectural synthesis:</strong> Unified framework explaining why formal results (Skalse) and empirical validation (Greenblatt) both follow from single mechanism</li>
    <li><strong>Mechanistic connection:</strong> Skalse's geometric proof applies to 2-layer systems; architectural isolation moves Protocol outside optimization polytope Ω</li>
    <li><strong>Game-structural insight:</strong> Greenblatt's formalization shows 3-layer systems change game from single-player to multi-player with enforcer</li>
    <li><strong>Novel prediction derived from Proposition 3:</strong> Safety advantage increases with capability as direct consequence of Skalse et al.'s formal result</li>
    <li><strong>Practical guidance:</strong> Implementation patterns achieving 92-98% safety with 10-20% overhead</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Current status:</strong></p>

<p>Architectures implementing privilege separation provide substantial safety improvements (<strong>15% → 92-98% in Greenblatt et al.'s experiments</strong>). They remain challenged by:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Weak-to-strong problem (critical uncertainty as capabilities scale)</li>
    <li>Specification problem (Protocol needs correct rules)</li>
    <li>Monitoring overhead (10-20% cost)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Priority research:</strong> Test Prediction 4 to validate whether Proposition 3's mechanism predicts privilege separation advantages increase with model capability. This tests whether architectural solutions become more or less critical approaching AGI.</p>

<p>The question is not whether privilege separation provides advantages (Greenblatt et al. demonstrate substantial improvements at current scales), but whether these advantages scale with capability as Proposition 3 predicts. Prediction 4 tests this directly.</p>

<p><strong>Epistemic status:</strong> This paper synthesizes existing formal and empirical results (Skalse et al. 2023, Greenblatt et al. 2024, Shah et al. 2022) into a unified architectural framework. The Privilege Separation Principle is an architectural interpretation of existing formal work, not a novel mathematical proof. Prediction 4 is derived from Skalse et al.'s Proposition 3 and is genuinely predictive and falsifiable. Empirical claims are verified from primary sources.</p>

<p><strong>Note on review process:</strong> This paper has not undergone external peer review. The synthesis and architectural framework were developed through AI-assisted iteration but have not been validated by human domain experts. Readers should evaluate claims critically and verify citations independently.</p>

<p><strong>Acknowledgments:</strong> Thanks to Joar Skalse and colleagues for rigorous geometric analysis of Goodhart dynamics (Proposition 3), and the AI Control team (Ryan Greenblatt, Buck Shlegeris, et al.) for empirical validation and game-theoretic formalization. This work synthesizes their foundational contributions.</p>

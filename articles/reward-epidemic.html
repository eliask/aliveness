<h1>The Reward Epidemic</h1>

<p class="subtitle">Two transmission vectors, one ontological infection</p>

<hr>

<h2>I. Two Ontologies</h2>

<p>There are two ways to see a job.</p>

<p><strong>Functional:</strong> The pilot's seat exists because the plane must fly. The job is a burden of competence. Status and pay are incentives to attract the scarce person who can do it. Aristotle's answer to "who gets the flute?" was the best flute player—because flutes exist to produce music.</p>

<p><strong>Distributive:</strong> The pilot's seat is a desirable position—income, prestige, autonomy. The job is an asset to be distributed fairly. If some groups hold more seats, that's a justice problem.</p>

<p>Both frames are ancient. What's new is that the distributive frame achieved epidemic spread in the late 20th century. It has two transmission vectors: one from above, one from below.</p>

<hr>

<h2>II. Vector 1: The Top-Down Infection</h2>

<p>The philosophical transmission route runs through three steps.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Rawls commodifies the position.</strong> In <em>A Theory of Justice</em> (1971), John Rawls categorized "powers and prerogatives of offices" as <em>social primary goods</em>—things every rational person wants. This subtle move reframed the surgeon's authority from a heavy responsibility into a benefit the holder enjoys. Once the office is a benefit, its distribution becomes a question of justice.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2: Fair Equality of Opportunity elevates access over output.</strong> Rawls's FEO principle demands that people of equal talent have equal prospects regardless of background. This sounds functional—but Rawls argued that being excluded from high-status positions deprives one of "one of the main forms of human good: self-realization." The job is now a vehicle for the self. Excluding the incompetent becomes a moral harm, not a quality filter.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3: The function is assumed invariant.</strong> In the political digestion of Rawls, the job splits into two parts: the <em>reward</em> (status, income, power) and the <em>function</em> (the actual work). Policy focused on redistributing the reward while assuming the function would survive. This is the Distributive Fallacy: the belief that you can alter who holds the role without degrading what the role produces.</p>

<p>This vector infected the credentialing pipeline. If jobs are primary goods, then degrees are tickets to primary goods, and university admissions become the central battleground of justice. The actual competence of the graduate becomes secondary to the possession of the credential.</p>

<hr>

<h2>III. Vector 2: The Bottom-Up Infection</h2>

<p>The philosophical vector requires reading Rawls. The empirical vector requires only eyes.</p>

<p>You work in an organization. Down the hall sits the Director of Strategic Partnerships. You've been there two years. You have never seen this person produce anything. They attend meetings. They have a title, an office, a salary larger than yours. They are, by any functional measure, occupying a reward.</p>

<p>You now hold a piece of evidence. And from it you draw a <em>correct</em> inference: that job is not a function. It's a prize.</p>

<p>This is the moment of infection. You didn't read Rawls. You didn't adopt an ideology. You looked at reality and drew a rational conclusion. Once you've seen a single reward-job, the distributive frame is no longer philosophy—it's empirical observation. And the next step is immediate: if prizes are being handed out, then the distribution of prizes is a justice question. <em>Why not me?</em></p>

<p>The pathogen is not a bad idea. It's a correct inference from a broken system.</p>

<hr>

<h2>IV. Convergence</h2>

<p>The two vectors meet in the middle. The philosophical vector provides the moral vocabulary ("fair access," "representation," "equity"). The empirical vector provides the lived motivation ("I can see the bullshit job; I want mine"). Each amplifies the other:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Rawlsian philosophy <em>legitimizes</em> the inference from observation.</li>
    <li>Observed reward-jobs <em>validate</em> the philosophy with evidence.</li>
</ul>

<p>This convergence explains why the distributive frame is so resistant to counter-argument. You can't refute the philosophy, because it's backed by visible evidence. You can't dismiss the evidence, because it's backed by moral philosophy. The frame is anchored on both ends.</p>

<hr>

<h2>V. The Immunocompromised Host</h2>

<p>The epidemic spreads so fast because the host population is pre-susceptible. The functional frame isn't natural—it's a late, effortful cognitive achievement fighting against a full stack of defaults:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Status-comparison hardware.</strong> Primate brains are wired for relative status monitoring. A visible reward-job triggers comparison circuits that are evolutionary, not learned. The distributive inference rides on pre-installed wetware.</li>
    <li><strong>Fairness-punishment instinct.</strong> Ultimatum game results are cross-cultural and appear in other primates. Humans will destroy value to punish distributions they perceive as unfair. The distributive frame activates this reflex directly: <em>unfair distribution → punish the distributor</em>.</li>
    <li><strong>Developmental default.</strong> Children begin with strict egalitarianism—everyone gets the same share. Merit-based, input-proportional allocation is a developmentally later achievement requiring systems thinking. Under stress, cognitive load, or emotional activation, adults regress toward the cheaper frame.</li>
    <li><strong>Third-party blindness.</strong> People naturally model the visible dyad: employer ↔ applicant. The functional frame requires modeling the <em>absent</em> third party—the patient who needs the surgeon to be competent, the passenger who needs the pilot to be qualified. That absent stakeholder has no emotional salience, no face, no lobby.</li>
    <li><strong>Salience asymmetry.</strong> One visible bullshit job is more memorable than a hundred invisible functional jobs working correctly. The pathogen has an attentional advantage built into how human perception works.</li>
</ul>

<p>The functional frame has to fight uphill against every one of these. It survives only where external scaffolding—exams, markets, scoreboards, physics—does the cognitive work that intuition refuses to do.</p>

<hr>

<h2>VI. R<sub>0</sub></h2>

<p>The reproduction rate depends on one variable: <strong>feedback opacity</strong>.</p>

<p>In <strong>high-feedback environments</strong>—surgery, aviation, competitive sports—the pathogen cannot reproduce. Incompetence produces a visible corpse, a crash, a losing season. The functional frame gets validated daily. R<sub>0</sub> ≈ 0.</p>

<p>In <strong>low-feedback environments</strong>—bureaucracy, HR, academia, corporate strategy—incompetence is delayed, diffuse, or deniable. The reward-job can exist indefinitely without correction. Every such job is a new transmission event. R<sub>0</sub> >> 1.</p>

<p>This is why the epidemic colonizes precisely the sectors where output is hardest to measure—and why it meets a hard wall at the sectors where physics still enforces consequences.</p>

<hr>

<h2>VII. The Loop</h2>

<p>The epidemic is self-amplifying:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Bureaucracies generate reward-jobs (administrative bloat, sinecures, political appointments).</li>
    <li>The philosophical vector provides moral cover ("these positions advance equity").</li>
    <li>Observers correctly identify them as rewards (empirical vector).</li>
    <li>Infected observers demand fair distribution.</li>
    <li>Political pressure creates <em>more</em> reward-jobs.</li>
    <li>Go to 2.</li>
</ol>

<p>At each step, the functional answer exists: <em>eliminate the bullshit job</em>. But this creates an enemy. The distributive answer—<em>distribute the bullshit jobs more fairly</em>—creates a beneficiary. Political systems <a href="governance-alignment-problem">optimize for beneficiaries</a>. The loop has a ratchet.</p>

<p>Historical precedent: this is not new. The Ancien Régime sold government offices for cash. Judgeships were private property, inheritable and tradeable. The functional competence of the officeholder was secondary to the revenue the Crown extracted from the sale. Napoleon's <em>carrière ouverte aux talents</em>—"careers open to talent"—was a violent reassertion of the functional frame. It lasted about a century before the distributive frame began reasserting itself under new moral vocabulary.</p>

<hr>

<h2>VIII. Endemic Equilibrium</h2>

<p>When enough people hold the distributive frame, it becomes the culture:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Demanding functional competence is reframed as gatekeeping.</li>
    <li>Objective selection criteria (exams, tests, output metrics) are attacked as barriers to fair distribution.</li>
    <li>The word "meritocracy" becomes pejorative.</li>
    <li>Functional holdouts are diagnosed with a moral deficiency ("toxic meritocracy," "elitism").</li>
</ul>

<p>The frame has flipped. The disease presents as health. The immune response presents as disease.</p>

<p>A diagnostic test exists: observe which jobs are contested. If the movement demands equity in boardrooms and professorships (high-status rewards) but not in sewage maintenance and deep-sea fishing (high-risk functions), the underlying ontology is distributive, not functional. The "Glass Ceiling" is contested; the "Glass Cellar" is ignored. The movement is distributing prizes, not sharing burdens.</p>

<hr>

<h2>IX. Herd Immunity</h2>

<p>The pathogen cannot be defeated by argument, because the bottom-up vector is not an error in reasoning. It's a correct inference from visible evidence. You cannot talk someone out of what they can see.</p>

<p>The only vaccine is <strong>architectural</strong>: make failure visible.</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Tight feedback loops:</strong> Connect output to consequence. Markets do this (bankruptcy). Sports do this (scoreboard). Bureaucracies don't.</li>
    <li><strong>Named accountability:</strong> Attach outcomes permanently to the names of decision-makers. When consequences are public, the reward-job becomes a liability, not a prize.</li>
    <li><strong>Eliminate opacity:</strong> The pathogen reproduces in darkness. If every role must demonstrate measurable output, the reward-job has nowhere to hide.</li>
</ul>

<p>The functional frame is the <a href="only-selection">historical anomaly</a>—a brief achievement of the Napoleonic and Progressive eras, maintained only where physics enforces consequences directly. The distributive frame is the human default, constantly reasserting itself under new moral vocabularies. Maintaining function requires active architectural defense against reversion, the same way maintaining complexity requires active defense against entropy.</p>

<p><strong>The epidemic doesn't need a conspiracy. It needs one bullshit job and a pair of eyes. Philosophy arrives later to explain why the infection was justice all along.</strong></p>

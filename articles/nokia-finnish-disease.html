<h1>The Nokia Phase Transition</h1>

<p class="subtitle">How windfall wealth locks in civilizational decline</p>

<hr>

<h2>I. The Mirage</h2>

<p>For fifteen years (1995–2010), Finland lived in a dream. The country appeared to be the most innovative, efficient, and future-oriented nation on Earth—world's best schools, world's best welfare state, world's biggest mobile phone company.</p>

<p>The standard narrative: Finland succeeded because of its <em>system</em>. The Nordic Model worked. Education, social trust, and smart industrial policy produced a miracle.</p>

<p>The reality: Finland succeeded because of a <em>singularity</em>. One company, Nokia, generated an illusion of systemic competence that masked deepening structural decay.</p>

<p>At its peak, Nokia contributed <strong>4% of Finnish GDP</strong>, <strong>23% of all corporate tax revenue</strong>, <strong>over 20% of exports</strong>, and <strong>70% of the Helsinki Stock Exchange's value</strong>. It wasn't a company. It was a second sun.</p>

<p>And like Icarus, Finland flew too close. The warmth convinced an entire nation that it had beaten the laws of economic physics.</p>

<h2>II. The Standard Story: Dutch Disease</h2>

<p>Economists have a name for what happened: "Dutch Disease." When a windfall sector (oil, gas, or in Finland's case, mobile phones) floods an economy with wealth, it crowds out everything else.</p>

<p><strong>The talent vacuum:</strong> The best engineering talent concentrated at Nokia. The "undergrowth" of potential startups withered because the giant oak blocked the sunlight. International venture capital largely ignored Finland as a "one-company town."</p>

<p><strong>The cost contagion:</strong> Nokia paid global wages for local talent. This raised costs across the entire economy, making traditional industries—paper, steel, machinery—uncompetitive on export markets.</p>

<p><strong>The skills trap:</strong> Universities restructured curricula around Nokia's needs. Thousands of engineers were trained in proprietary skills (Symbian architecture, signal processing) that became worthless overnight when the smartphone paradigm shifted.</p>

<p><strong>The R&D monopoly:</strong> Nokia accounted for nearly half of all private sector R&D spending in Finland. When the company collapsed, national R&D intensity—once world-leading at nearly 4% of GDP—collapsed with it. Government R&D programs cannot easily substitute for private sector allocation. Less R&D today means fewer patents and products tomorrow.</p>

<p>But this is not the worst part.</p>

<h2>III. The Phase Transition</h2>

<p>The standard Dutch Disease story implies a recoverable situation: the windfall ends, the economy adjusts, things normalize. You had a big party, now you have a hangover, eventually you're fine.</p>

<p>Finland's situation is different. The Nokia era didn't just <em>delay</em> necessary adaptation. It funded a <strong>phase transition</strong> to a higher-entropy institutional state that cannot be reversed.</p>

<p>Delay means: you arrive at the same destination later. Phase transition means: you cross a threshold beyond which the original destination becomes unreachable. The fiscal damage is the visible symptom. The real damage is to the substrate: the human capital, institutional integrity, demographic base, and cultural capacity for adaptation that constitute actual civilizational wealth.</p>

<h3>The Ratchet Mechanism</h3>

<p>Nokia's tax revenue flooded the state treasury. Politicians spent the windfall on welfare state expansion rather than future productive capacity.</p>

<p>This created a ratchet:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Nokia money funds new entitlements and public sector expansion</li>
    <li>Entitlements create constituencies (public sector unions, beneficiary classes)</li>
    <li>Constituencies vote to protect their benefits</li>
    <li>Benefits become legally and politically locked in</li>
    <li>When revenue disappears, obligations remain</li>
</ol>

<p>You cannot simply "go back to 1995 spending levels." The political economy has structurally changed. The people whose livelihoods depend on the expanded state are now a voting majority.</p>

<h3>The Institutional Capture Window</h3>

<p>Finland's legal and academic institutions had been undergoing ideological capture since the 1970s, part of the broader Western pattern. But capture takes time. Institutions have memory, incumbent personnel, residual resistance.</p>

<p>Nokia money bought twenty years of <em>no fiscal pressure</em>. Twenty years during which captured institutions could hire exclusively from ideologically aligned candidates, train a full generation in captured universities, lock in legal frameworks without fiscal accountability, and eliminate alternative power bases that might resist.</p>

<p>The kassakaappisopimus and Lex Nokia—detailed below—demonstrate how completely Nokia captured the political class. But the capture extended beyond politics: twenty years of fiscal comfort allowed educational and media institutions to drift without accountability, hiring from the same ideological pools, resistant to criticism because the money kept flowing.</p>

<p>By 2010, almost no one in Finnish institutions remembered what the country was like before the capture. Each cohort had hired the next cohort. The Nokia era funded more than the welfare state. It funded the <em>completion</em> of institutional colonization.</p>

<h3>The Talent Destruction</h3>

<p>The skills mismatch story (Symbian engineers can't write iOS apps) is real but superficial. The deeper damage: Nokia absorbed a disproportionate share of Finland's high-agency technical talent for fifteen years.</p>

<p>Engineers who might have started companies or challenged institutions sat in Espoo optimizing antenna designs.</p>

<p>When Nokia collapsed, these people were 40-50 years old with obsolete skills and no entrepreneurial experience. A generation of potential founders, reformers, and institution-builders had been <em>consumed</em> by a single corporate silo.</p>

<h3>The Counterfactual Destruction</h3>

<p>The companies that might have grown instead of Nokia—the diversified industrial base Finland could have had—were never born. Promising startups were acquired early to serve as Nokia suppliers. Capital flowed to Nokia's ecosystem, not to alternatives. The paths not taken are permanently closed.</p>

<h2>IV. State Capture: From Strongbox to Surveillance</h2>

<p>The most damaging legacy was not economic but institutional. Nokia became so dominant that the Finnish state became its subsidiary. This capture didn't begin in 2008. It began two decades earlier.</p>

<h3>The Strongbox Contract (1987)</h3>

<p>In the 1980s, Nokia CEO Kari Kairamo was not merely a business leader—he was a political architect. Kairamo believed that for Nokia to succeed globally, Finnish politics had to be engineered to support it.</p>

<p>Historical records reveal the existence of the <em>kassakaappisopimus</em>—the "strongbox contract"—a secret, handwritten pact brokered by Kairamo between the leaders of the Centre Party, the National Coalition Party (Kokoomus), and the Swedish People's Party (RKP). The agreement outlined a plan to form a non-socialist "bourgeois" coalition government after the 1987 elections, with Centre's Paavo Väyrynen as Prime Minister. Kairamo personally drafted clauses designed to force "structural change" in the Finnish economy—liberalized capital markets, aggressive infrastructure modernization, industrial competitiveness prioritized over other social goals.</p>

<p>President Mauno Koivisto partially subverted the plot, using his constitutional powers to appoint Harri Holkeri (Kokoomus) instead of Väyrynen. But the industrial policy Kairamo wanted was implemented anyway. The Holkeri Government enacted the "hallittu rakennemuutos" (controlled structural change), liberalizing the economy and setting the stage for the casino economy of the late 1980s.</p>

<p>The specific personnel changed; the capture succeeded. A private corporation had drafted government policy before the government was even formed. The conflation of Nokia's corporate strategy with Finland's national strategy began here. "What is good for Nokia is good for Finland" became unquestioned dogma, and anyone questioning this was questioning Finland itself.</p>

<h3>Lex Nokia (2008)</h3>

<p>Twenty years later, the pattern repeated—this time in the open.</p>

<p>When Nokia suspected an employee was leaking trade secrets to Huawei, Finnish privacy law prevented the company from accessing email metadata. Nokia's response: demand the law be changed.</p>

<p>According to reporting in <em>Helsingin Sanomat</em>, Nokia issued an ultimatum to the government: pass the surveillance law or we relocate headquarters out of Finland. While Nokia officially denied making explicit threats, government insiders and multiple media outlets corroborated the pressure campaign.</p>

<p>Parliament capitulated. The bill passed 96-56 in the Eduskunta, with 47 MPs conveniently absent. Constitutional law scholars including Professor Jukka Kemppinen argued the law violated fundamental rights enshrined in the Finnish Constitution and international human rights treaties. Civil liberties organizations including Electronic Frontier Finland (Effi) opposed it. None of this mattered. The law granted employers the right to monitor employee email metadata without court order—privacy protections weakened at the command of a private corporation.</p>

<p>The kassakaappisopimus of 1987 established that Nokia could shape government composition. Lex Nokia of 2008 demonstrated that Nokia could rewrite constitutional protections. These were not isolated incidents. They were bookends of a twenty-year pattern in which the Finnish state functioned as Nokia's political subsidiary.</p>

<p>This is what institutional capture looks like: not dramatic corruption, but the quiet assumption that corporate interests <em>are</em> national interests, that what the anchor firm needs, the nation must provide.</p>

<h2>V. The Evidence of Phase Transition</h2>

<p>If Nokia merely delayed Finland's reckoning, post-Nokia Finland should look like pre-Nokia Finland plus a recession. Instead, it looks fundamentally worse—not just fiscally, but in every dimension that constitutes civilizational capacity.</p>

<p><strong>Fiscal:</strong> Pre-Nokia Finland had a modest welfare state operating within its means. During-Nokia Finland expanded that welfare state dramatically, funded by windfall revenue. Post-Nokia Finland has the expanded welfare state but without the revenue—a permanent structural deficit. Debt-to-GDP has ballooned from ~30% to over 75%.</p>

<p><strong>Demographic:</strong> All Nordic countries have experienced fertility decline since 2010, but Finland's is the steepest: a 33% drop compared to Sweden's 28% and Denmark's 22%. Finland's TFR peaked at 1.87 in 2010, then collapsed: 1.65 (2015), 1.35 (2019), 1.26 (2023), 1.25 (2024)—now classified as "lowest-low" fertility. A TFR of 1.25 means each generation is barely half the size of the one preceding it. The voters of 2040 are already determined: older, more dependent, less capable of bearing the welfare state's costs. This is not a fiscal problem. It is a substrate problem: the humans required for recovery are not being born.</p>

<p><strong>Institutional:</strong> The 2008 Lex Nokia demonstrated that parliamentary independence was compromised. Post-Nokia, no countervailing force emerged to restore institutional integrity. The capture completed during the Nokia years remains in place.</p>

<p><strong>Industrial:</strong> The alternative companies that might have provided a diversified export base were never built. Post-Nokia Finland had to start from near-zero in building a startup ecosystem. The "Slush" conference and the celebrated startup boom are reactions to the monoculture—desperate necessity, not organic evolution. The human cost was concentrated in company towns: Salo, once the "Nokia Capital," lost a fifth of its labor force when the flagship factory closed. Oulu's tech scene was gutted when Microsoft cut 2,300 ex-Nokia jobs in 2014.</p>

<h3>The Broken Window Fallacy: Why Startups Don't Prove Recovery</h3>

<p>A sophisticated objection: "But Finland has Supercell, Wolt, Slush, and a thriving startup scene. Doesn't this prove recovery is possible?"</p>

<p>No. It proves triage is possible.</p>

<p>When Nokia collapsed, it ran the "Bridge" program—offering grants up to €25,000 for laid-off employees to start their own businesses. The program spawned over 1,000 startups. This is celebrated as a success story of creative destruction.</p>

<p>But consider what actually happened:</p>

<p><strong>The lost generation:</strong> The engineers who founded these startups were 40-50 years old. They had spent their prime entrepreneurial years (ages 25-40) optimizing antenna designs in Espoo. The startups they could have founded in 2000—with fifteen years of compound growth by 2015—were never built. The Bridge startups are not replacements for those lost companies. They are late-stage consolation prizes.</p>

<p><strong>The survival rate:</strong> Most Bridge startups were consultancies, acqui-hire targets, or failures. The celebrated Finnish gaming successes (Rovio, Supercell) predated or were independent of the Bridge program—they are not evidence that Nokia's collapse created opportunity, but survivorship bias from a separate ecosystem.</p>

<p><strong>The exit destinations:</strong> Finland's startup unicorns were sold to foreigners. Supercell went to SoftBank (Japan). Wolt went to DoorDash (USA). The value created didn't stay in Finland—it was extracted by foreign capital. This is the pattern of a colony, not a recovered economy.</p>

<p><strong>The counterfactual test:</strong> If Nokia had never existed, would Finland's startup ecosystem be larger or smaller in 2025? Almost certainly larger. The talent hoarded by Nokia for fifteen years would have been distributed across dozens of companies. Some would have failed. Others would have become the diversified industrial base Finland needed. The Slush conference is a monument to what could have been—built by people trying to recreate from scratch what Nokia's monoculture prevented from ever existing.</p>

<p>The startup boom doesn't falsify the phase transition thesis. It confirms it. Recovery requires starting from near-zero because the substrate that would have enabled organic growth was consumed. The startups are impressive given the damage—but they cannot restore the lost counterfactual, reverse the demographic decline, or uncapture the institutions. They are triage, not cure.</p>

<h3>Why Finland and Not Others?</h3>

<p>Other countries experienced similar corporate dominance without triggering phase transitions. Why was Finland different?</p>

<p><strong>Sweden vs. Finland:</strong> Sweden possesses a diversified industrial base: Ericsson (telecom), Volvo (vehicles), Scania (machinery), H&M (retail), and a robust banking sector. When Ericsson faced crisis in the early 2000s, the Swedish economy absorbed the shock because other engines kept firing. At no point did a single Swedish company approach Nokia's 4% of GDP, 20% of exports, or 70% of stock market capitalization. Sweden had industrial depth. Finland had a monoculture.</p>

<p><strong>Canada vs. Finland:</strong> BlackBerry's collapse devastated Waterloo, Ontario, but remained a regional crisis, not a sovereign one. Canada's economy—resource extraction, banking, manufacturing, multiple tech hubs in Toronto, Vancouver, and Montreal—provided geographic and sectoral buffers. BlackBerry was never "Canada" the way Nokia was "Finland." The correlation between BlackBerry's stock price and Canada's GDP was low. The correlation between Nokia's stock price and Finland's GDP was dangerously high—a failure of national risk management.</p>

<p><strong>The pattern:</strong> Monoculture creates fragility. Diversification creates resilience. Finland allowed Nokia to become its entire economic identity, and when that identity collapsed, there was nothing underneath. The phase transition occurred because Finland had no shock absorbers—and Nokia's success had prevented those shock absorbers from ever being built.</p>

<h2>VI. The General Mechanism</h2>

<p>Finland exemplifies a general phenomenon: <strong>windfall wealth as phase transition catalyst</strong>.</p>

<p>Any windfall—Nokia, North Sea oil, commodity boom, financial bubble—can trigger irreversible institutional decay if:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Duration exceeds institutional memory</strong> (~15-20 years). Long enough for the windfall to seem permanent, for personnel to turn over, for alternatives to atrophy.</li>
    <li><strong>Scale exceeds prudent absorption capacity.</strong> Large enough to fund major expansions rather than being saved or invested conservatively.</li>
    <li><strong>Political system lacks constitutional constraints</strong> on spending. No mechanism prevents converting temporary revenue into permanent obligations.</li>
</ol>

<p>When all three conditions hold, the windfall doesn't make a country richer. It funds a trajectory toward permanent decline: not just bankruptcy (which is recoverable) but substrate degradation—the loss of the human capital, institutional knowledge, and demographic base required for recovery. The capable leave. The dependent stay. Each year the remaining population is slightly less able to self-correct. The fiscal crisis is just the visible symptom of a deeper phase transition that has already occurred.</p>

<h3>The Thermodynamic Frame</h3>

<p>Windfalls inject low-entropy energy (concentrated wealth) into a system. A healthy system would use this energy to build productive capacity. A captured system uses the energy to <em>increase its own entropy</em>: expand bureaucracy, create dependencies, lock in consumption patterns, eliminate accountability mechanisms.</p>

<p>When the energy injection stops, the entropy remains. You cannot "unexpand" the bureaucracy. The phase transition is one-way.</p>

<h3>Why Windfalls Are Worse Than Poverty</h3>

<p><strong>Poverty with selection pressure is often better than windfall wealth without institutional safeguards</strong> for long-term civilizational health.</p>

<p>Poverty creates pressure to adapt. Mistakes are punished quickly. Feedback loops work. Institutions that don't function get reformed or replaced because there's no money to sustain dysfunction.</p>

<p>Windfalls <em>remove</em> pressure during the critical window when adaptation would otherwise occur. Institutions evolve to consume the windfall rather than to produce value. When the windfall ends, you have poverty <em>plus</em> maladapted institutions—the worst of both worlds.</p>

<p>(Note: This does not mean all poverty is preferable to all wealth. Botswana's diamond windfall with good governance produced better outcomes than the DRC's poverty with dysfunction. The claim is conditional: poverty with adaptation pressure beats windfall without safeguards.)</p>

<h2>VII. Counterfactual Finland</h2>

<p><strong>Finland without Nokia (1990-2010):</strong> Fiscal pressure in the 1990s forces welfare state reform. Multiple mid-sized export companies develop, creating a diversified industrial base. Talent distributes across the economy. Institutions face accountability pressure, limiting ideological capture. Maybe Finland hits a wall in the 2000s—but from a <em>recoverable</em> position.</p>

<p><strong>Finland with Nokia (actual history):</strong> No fiscal pressure until 2008. All eggs in one basket. Talent concentrated in a single company. Institutions captured during the windfall window. Finland hits the wall in 2008 from an <em>unrecoverable</em> position.</p>

<p>The counterfactual Finland—poorer in 2005, healthier in 2025—was prevented from existing by Nokia's success.</p>

<h2>VIII. The Soviet Echo</h2>

<p>Nokia was not Finland's first experience with monolithic dependency.</p>

<p>For centuries, Finland existed in the shadow of larger powers: Sweden, then Russia. After World War II, bilateral trade arrangements with the Soviet Union provided guaranteed markets—comfortable but breeding structural rigidity. When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, Finland faced a brutal recession. The comfortable dependency had masked underlying weakness.</p>

<p>Nokia emerged from that crisis as the new monolith. And Finland repeated the pattern: guaranteed revenue, structural rigidity, no need to diversify because the golden goose kept laying eggs.</p>

<p>The lesson Finland should have learned in 1991—<em>do not build your economy around a single point of failure</em>—was not learned. Instead, Finland traded dependence on Moscow for dependence on Espoo. Whether this pattern reflects something deep in Finnish political culture or merely path-dependent accident, the Nokia trauma is not an isolated event but the latest iteration of a recurring national failure mode.</p>

<h2>IX. The Selection Effect</h2>

<p>The final mechanism: <strong>brain drain</strong>.</p>

<p>During the Nokia years, ambitious Finns had two options: work for Nokia, or leave. Many left—for London, Silicon Valley, Berlin. The ones who stayed were disproportionately those who valued security over ambition, those who fit the Nokia mold, or those who couldn't leave.</p>

<p>When Nokia collapsed, the selection reversed in the wrong direction. The capable people who had built lives abroad stayed abroad. Those who remained had optimized for the Nokia-era economy: risk-averse, specialized in obsolete skills, dependent on institutions that no longer functioned.</p>

<p>Each year, the selection pressure continues. Young Finns with ambition and talent look at the tax burden, the sclerotic institutions, the lack of opportunity, and many leave. Emigration is highest in the 25-34 age bracket—the prime productive and reproductive years. Only 19% of Finnish expats consider returning a "strong possibility." Between 2005 and 2015, Finland experienced a net loss of over 1,000 researchers and scientists. What remains skews older, more dependent, less capable of the entrepreneurial energy that recovery would require.</p>

<p>This substrate degradation makes recovery nearly impossible. You cannot reform institutions with a population selected for dependency. The people who would do the reforming have already left, or were never born, or were consumed by Nokia during their prime years.</p>

<p>The selection effect is the final lock on the trap. Fiscal damage can theoretically be repaired. Institutional capture can theoretically be reversed. But demographic selection cannot be undone on any policy-relevant timescale. The people are the substrate. The substrate is gone.</p>

<h2>X. The Lesson</h2>

<p>Was Nokia the worst thing to happen to Finland?</p>

<p>If you measure by the bank account of 2005: <strong>No.</strong> It made Finland rich.</p>

<p>If you measure by the structural health of 2025: <strong>Yes.</strong> It made Finland weak—degraded the substrate from which recovery could occur. The people, the institutions, the industrial diversity, the cultural capacity for risk-taking: these are the real wealth of a civilization, and Nokia's windfall funded their erosion.</p>

<p>The structural damage was compounded by cultural brittleness. Nokia bred hubris—management dismissed the iPhone as a niche toy while Finnish analysts failed to recognize the paradigm shift from hardware to software ecosystems. It bred managerialism—the "Finnish Dream" became a safe middle-management job at Nokia, not starting a company. It fused national identity to corporate identity—"Finland is Nokia" meant the collapse was experienced as national humiliation, not merely corporate failure. These psychological scars make reform harder even where it's structurally possible.</p>

<p>Nokia didn't delay Finland's reckoning. It funded the construction of the trap that makes reckoning impossible.</p>

<p>The "Lost Decade" framing (2008-2018) is wrong. Finland didn't lose those years. Finland lost 1995-2008—it just didn't know it yet. The wealth was real. The institutional damage happening underneath was also real. When the wealth disappeared, the damage became visible.</p>

<p>The debt Finland takes on today, the austerity it imposes, the political dysfunction it experiences—these are attempts to maintain a Nokia-era standard of living without a Nokia-era engine. The attempt will fail. The engine is gone, but the obligations it funded remain.</p>

<h2>XI. For Finland</h2>

<p>The phase transition thesis predicts that structural reform is both necessary and politically impossible. This is not a contradiction—it is the trap's signature. The constituencies created during the Nokia years (public sector unions, welfare beneficiaries, captured institutions) now constitute voting majorities whose rational self-interest blocks the reforms that solvency requires. The system cannot generate the political energy to escape the attractor it has fallen into.</p>

<p>Finland's future is managed decline: periodic austerity, gradual erosion of living standards, continued brain drain of the ambitious, and the slow normalization of being a former success story. The startup ecosystem provides hope and employment but cannot restore the lost generation, reverse the demographic damage, or uncapture the institutions. Finland will not collapse dramatically. It will simply become irrelevant—another small European country living on memories of better days.</p>

<h2>XII. For Others</h2>

<p><strong>Norway—Why Constitutional Precommitment Matters:</strong> Norway faced a similar windfall (North Sea oil) but engineered a different outcome. The critical difference was <em>sequencing</em>: Norway established its sovereign wealth fund in 1990, then added the <em>handlingsregelen</em> (fiscal rule) in 2001—both <em>before</em> oil revenues peaked. The rule originally limited spending to 4% of fund value, tightened to 3% in 2017. Crucially, all petroleum revenues are invested <em>outside</em> Norway, physically removing the windfall from the domestic economy.</p>

<p>This is precommitment: binding your future self before the temptation arrives. Finland received Nokia revenue <em>after</em> its welfare state and political culture were already established. There was no precommitment mechanism.</p>

<p>Finland did have a spending limit system—the <em>Kehys</em> (Spending Limits)—but it was fatally flawed. It excluded "automatic stabilizers" like unemployment benefits and housing allowances. It didn't cap the revenue side, so when Nokia taxes surged, political pressure to spend was irresistible. And it was merely a political agreement, not a constitutional lock. When the windfall arrived, Kehys provided no protection. The money flowed directly into expanded current spending.</p>

<p>Norway's fund is not a guarantee of escape—political pressure to spend grows continuously. But the constitutional constraint buys time. Finland tried and failed; the institutional will was absent when it mattered.</p>

<p><strong>Denmark (Novo Nordisk):</strong> The pharmaceutical giant now approaches Nokia-level dominance of the Danish economy. Danish policymakers should study Finland closely. The question is not whether Novo Nordisk will eventually decline—all companies do—but whether Denmark will have built diversification and constitutional constraints before that decline arrives.</p>

<p><strong>For any country experiencing windfall:</strong> The windfall is not a gift. It is a test—and the test is whether you can resist spending the money on present consumption when the political incentives all point toward spending.</p>

<p>Pass the test: establish constitutional constraints <em>before</em> the revenue peaks. Create sovereign wealth funds with binding spending limits. Diversify aggressively even when the windfall sector makes diversification seem unnecessary. Treat the windfall as temporary even when it feels permanent.</p>

<p>Fail the test: spend the windfall on welfare expansion, allow monoculture to develop, let institutions capture the revenue stream, and discover only when the windfall ends that you have funded not prosperity but the trap that makes prosperity impossible.</p>

<p>Almost every country fails the test. The incentives are that strong.</p>

<p><strong>The deepest lesson:</strong> The worst thing that can happen to a weakening system is a temporary reprieve. It will use the reprieve not to reform but to lock in the patterns that are killing it. Abundance is the enemy of adaptation. Comfort is the enemy of growth. The golden age funds the construction of the cage.</p>
